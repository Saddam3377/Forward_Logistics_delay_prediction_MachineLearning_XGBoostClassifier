# Forward_Logistics_delay_prediction_Machine-learning-Logistics-Regression-
Leveraging Machine Learning to eliminate supply chain bottlenecks. This project deploys a Logistic Regression model to predict potential delivery delays between fixed service centers. By analyzing historical dispatch patterns, the system provides actionable insights to optimize forward logistics and improve delivery reliability.
